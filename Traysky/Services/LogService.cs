///   background writer thread. If the queue is full (a burst faster than the disk),
///   lines are dropped rather than blocking the caller.</item>
///   <item>Bounded disk usage. The active file rolls to a single previous
///   generation at <see cref="MaxLogBytes"/>, so total on-disk size never exceeds
///   ~2× that. Size is tracked in memory to avoid a stat syscall per line.</item>
///   <item>Never throw into playback — every path is wrapped in try/catch.</item>
